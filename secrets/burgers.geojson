Bar Bar, which churns out thousands of never-fail cheeseburgers on the regular, is offering an homage to owner Jim Brunberg’s favorite Swiss mountain region: a quarter pound grass fed beef patty with sautéed mushrooms, onions, and bacon, melted Swiss cheese, and house made garlic aioli on a toasted potato bun. This is no pinkie-up eating—the rich toppings will ooze out onto your digits but never make that potato bun’s delightfully crisp edges go soggy. Order some freedom fries if you’re feeling too Continental.",

        "description": "This is Elephants' first time in the Burger Week game, but they've been watching. One of the things they've noticed is that while lots of Burger Week burgers draw from ethnic cuisines around the world, few focus on the Bavarian and Eastern European regions. The Pig Lebowski definitely rights that oversight. The ground pork patty also contains kielbasa sausage, a bit of bacon, caraway, and thyme. Add to that a stoneground mustard and mayo sauce and a generous portion of a delicious red cabbage slaw studded with pickle pieces. It all fits very nicely between two sliced of the house-baked-daily sesame bun. And to those who wonder if the Burger Week stampede will threaten their ability to deliver all hand-done patties, Elephants says, 'Bring it.'",
