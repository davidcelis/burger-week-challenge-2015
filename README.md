## The Challenge

I put forth a challenge to the city of Portland. Will you join me in attempting to eat every single one of these culinary delights?

### The Rules

By my calculations there are a total of 21 burgers listed. TWO of them are duplicates, as both Tilt and Slow Bar have submitted the same burger for their respective eastside and westside locations. This means that to complete the challenge you must eat all 19 UNIQUE burger entries. Eating all 21 would only be necessary as a bonus round if there needs to be a tie breaker. To summarize:

1. Eat All 19 Unique Burgers on the list
2. Complete the challenge before closing time on Sunday, August 17th
3. The challenge begins Monday, August 11th
