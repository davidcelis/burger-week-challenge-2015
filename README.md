### The Challenge

I put forth a challenge to the city of Portland. Will you join me in attempting to eat every single one of the culinary delights offered up by our fair city's burger purveyors for the time-honored BURGER WEEK tradition?

### The Rules

By my calculations there are a total of 32 unique burgers listed. One burger listed is a duplicate (Elephants' "The Pig Lebowski", available at two of their locations). To complete the challenge you must eat all 32 unique burger entries. Eating The Pig Lebowski twice would only be necessary under tie-breaker conditions. Evidence is required (a photo is preferred). It's also good to bring a witness. To summarize:

1. Eat All 32 unique burgers on the list
2. Document your eatings to provide evidence of challenge completion
3. You must finish every burger
4. No barfing
5. Complete the challenge before closing time on Sunday, August 16th

Can it be done? Should it be? Will you join me in this impossible dream?

The challenge begins Monday, August 10th. We suggest bringing a witness for authenticity and companionship.
