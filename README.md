### The Challenge

I put forth a challenge to the city of Portland. Will you join me in attempting to eat every single one of the culinary delights put forth by our fair city's burger purveyors for the time-honored BURGER WEEK tradition?

### The Rules

By my calculations there are a total of 21 burgers listed. TWO of them are duplicates, as both Tilt and Slow Bar have submitted the same burger for their respective eastside and westside locations. This means that to complete the challenge you must eat all 19 UNIQUE burger entries. Eating all 21 would only be necessary as a bonus round if there needs to be a tie breaker. Evidence is required (a photo is preferred). It's also good to bring a witness. To summarize:

1. Eat All 19 Unique Burgers on the list
1. Document your eatings to provide evidence of challenge completion
1. Bring a witness for companionship
1. Complete the challenge before closing time on Sunday, August 17th
1. The challenge begins Monday, August 11th

Can it be done? Should it be? Will you join me in this impossible dream?
